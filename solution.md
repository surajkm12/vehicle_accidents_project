### 4. Can we identify any trends in accidents based on the age of vehicles involved?

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
	SELECT  accidentindex,
			agevehicle,
			CASE
				WHEN agevehicle BETWEEN 0 AND 5 THEN 'New'
				WHEN agevehicle BETWEEN 6 AND 10 THEN 'Regular'
				ELSE 'Old'
			END AS agegroup
	FROM    vehicle
)
SELECT   agegroup, COUNT(accidentindex) AS total_accidents,  ROUND(AVG(agevehicle), 2) AS average_age
FROM     CTE
GROUP BY 1
```


**Result Set:**

agegroup |	total_accidents |	average_age |
--|--|--|
New |	61658 |	2.83 |
Old |	137141 |	13.73 |
Regular |	59046 |	8.06 |


---

### 5. Are there any specific weather conditions that contribute to severe accidents?

```sql
SELECT   weatherconditions, COUNT(severity) AS total_accidents
FROM     accident
WHERE    severity = 'Fatal'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

**Result Set:**

WeatherConditions |	total_accidents |
--|--|
Fine no high winds |	668 |
Raining no high winds |	84 |
Fine + high winds |	18 |
Unknown |	17 |
Raining + high winds |	17 |
Other |	7 |
Fog or mist |	5 |
Snowing no high winds |	1 |

### 6. Do accidents often involve impacts on the left-hand side of vehicles?

```sql
SELECT   lefthand, COUNT(accidentindex) AS total_accidents
FROM     vehicle
GROUP BY 1
HAVING   lefthand IS NOT NULL
```

**Result Set:**

LeftHand |	total_accidents |
--|--|
Data missing or out of range |	1019 |
No |	255480 |
Yes |	1346 |

### 7. Are there any relationships between journey purposes and the severity of accidents?

```sql
SELECT   journeypurpose, 
	     COUNT(severity) AS 'Total Accident',
	     CASE 
		     WHEN COUNT(severity) BETWEEN 0 AND 1000 THEN 'Low'
		     WHEN COUNT(severity) BETWEEN 1001 AND 3000 THEN 'Moderate'
		     ELSE 'High'
	     END AS 'Level'
FROM     accident a JOIN vehicle v USING(accidentindex)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

**Result Set:**

Other |	1573 |	Moderate |
Pupil riding to/from school |	817 |	Low |
Data missing or out of range |	24 |	Low |

### 8. Calculate the average age of vehicles involved in accidents , considering Day light and point of impact

```sql
SELECT   lightconditions, pointimpact, ROUND(AVG(agevehicle), 2) AS avg_vehicle_age
FROM     accident a JOIN vehicle v USING(accidentindex)
GROUP BY 1, 2
```

**Result Set:**

LightConditions |	PointImpact |	avg_vehicle_age |
--|--|--|
Darkness |	Back |	7.73 |
Darkness |	Did not impact |	6.8 |
Darkness |	Front |	8.22 |
Darkness |	Nearside |	7.75 |
Darkness |	Offside |	7.83 |
Daylight |	Back |	7.57 |
Daylight |	Data missing or out of range |	8.3 |
Daylight |	Did not impact |	7.51 |
Daylight |	Front |	8.31 |
Daylight |	Nearside |	7.91 |
